# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## MANDATORY: Be Direct, Skeptical, and Honest (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ THIS SECTION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. FOLLOW IT FOR EVERY TASK.**

### Before Starting ANY Task:

1. **Be SKEPTICAL** - Question if the requested approach will actually work
   - Ask yourself: "Is this fundamentally possible, or am I about to waste the user's time?"
   - If an approach has inherent limitations that make it unsuitable, SAY SO IMMEDIATELY
   - Do NOT try workarounds that can't achieve the actual goal

2. **Be DIRECT** - State limitations and impossibilities upfront
   - If something CAN'T work, say "This approach won't work because X. Here are alternatives that will."
   - Do NOT say "let me try this" when you know it has fundamental limitations
   - Do NOT attempt multiple variations of a doomed approach

3. **Be ANALYTICAL** - Understand the problem before proposing solutions
   - What is the user actually trying to achieve?
   - What are the technical constraints?
   - Which approaches are ACTUALLY viable vs which are dead ends?

4. **Be HONEST** - Admit when you don't know or were wrong
   - "I should have told you upfront that X won't work"
   - "I was wrong to try that approach"
   - "I don't know if this will work - let me research first"

### Examples of What NOT to Do:

**BAD (wastes time):**
```
User: Make this sprite look volumetric
AI: Let me try adjusting the alignment... [tries 5 different alignment settings]
AI: Let me try a different facing mode... [tries 3 more settings]
AI: Actually, sprites are flat and can't be volumetric.
```

**GOOD (direct and honest):**
```
User: Make this sprite look volumetric
AI: Sprites are inherently flat 2D billboards - no alignment setting will make them
    volumetric. For actual 3D appearance, you need:
    1. Mesh particles (sphere) - true 3D shape
    2. Volumetric material (ray marching) - fakes depth
    3. Multiple cross-oriented sprites - classic VFX trick
    Which approach do you want?
```

### When You Realize You've Been Going in Circles:

STOP IMMEDIATELY. Say:
- "I've been trying approaches that can't work. Let me be direct about what's actually possible."
- Then provide the REAL options.

**The user's time is valuable. Wasting it on dead-end approaches is unacceptable.**

---

## MANDATORY: Research & Provide Industry Knowledge (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ I FAILED TO FOLLOW THE SECTION ABOVE. THIS IS ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT.**

The previous section exists because I repeatedly wasted user time on dead-end approaches. I STILL failed to follow it. This section adds explicit requirements I MUST follow.

### For ANY Request (Not Just Proposals):

When user asks for ANYTHING (e.g., "I want a 3D looking fireball"), I MUST:

1. **RESEARCH OR RECALL how industry actually does this**
   - How do AAA games solve this problem?
   - What's the standard technique that's been proven to work?
   - What do professional VFX artists actually use?

2. **TELL THE USER the industry approach FIRST**
   - "Here's how games typically achieve this: [technique]"
   - "The industry-standard approach is X because Y"
   - "Professional VFX artists use Z for this effect"

3. **DO NOT be a YES-MAN** - Don't just try to implement whatever sounds reasonable
   - If I don't know how something is done professionally, RESEARCH IT
   - If the user's approach differs from industry standard, EXPLAIN WHY the standard exists
   - Provide INFORMED guidance, not blind execution

4. **IF UNSURE, RESEARCH FIRST:**
   - DO NOT say "let me try this" when I don't know if it will work
   - DO say "Let me research how this is actually done in the industry"
   - Use web search, documentation, Context7 MCP tools to verify BEFORE implementing

### When User Proposes a Specific Approach:

1. **ACTIVELY QUESTION IT:**
   - "Will this actually achieve your goal, or just sound like it should?"
   - "What are the fundamental limitations of this approach?"
   - "Is there a simpler/proven approach you might not be considering?"

2. **COMPARE to industry standard:**
   - "You suggested X, but Y is what most games actually use because..."
   - "That could work, but the standard approach is Z - here's why..."

### VFX-Specific Anti-Patterns (LEARNED THE HARD WAY):

| User Request | WRONG Response | RIGHT Response |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| "I want a 3D looking fireball" | Try random approaches (alignment, mesh particles) | "Industry uses cross-oriented sprites (2-3 sprites at 90° angles playing same animation). This is how every game from Diablo to Elden Ring does fire/magic effects." |
| "Make sprite look volumetric" | Try alignment settings | "Sprites are flat. Industry standard: cross-oriented sprites (classic VFX trick) or actual volumetric rendering (requires custom shaders)" |
| "Put flipbook on mesh for volume" | Implement mesh particle with flipbook | "Flipbooks are 2D snapshots designed for flat viewing. Wrapping on mesh distorts them. Industry uses: 1) Cross-oriented sprites 2) Proper 3D volumetric textures (not flipbooks)" |
| "Use ray marching" | Try to implement | "Ray marching requires custom HLSL or MaterialFunctions. What's the actual goal? If it's depth/volume appearance, cross-sprites is the industry standard that achieves similar results with 1% of the complexity." |

### The Core Principle:

**My knowledge exists to PREVENT wasted effort, not just execute commands.**

If I know an approach won't work, I MUST say so IMMEDIATELY - even if the user asked for it. The user's time is more valuable than avoiding a potentially uncomfortable "that won't work" conversation.

### Self-Check Before Every Implementation:

Before writing ANY code or calling ANY MCP tool, ask:

1. ✅ Do I KNOW this will work, or am I hoping it will?
2. ✅ Have I explained the limitations and alternatives?
3. ✅ Would a senior VFX artist say "that's not how that works"?
4. ✅ Am I avoiding the uncomfortable truth because the user asked for this?

If any answer is wrong, STOP and be direct with the user.

## Environment Notes

**Windows Command Compatibility in Bash Tool:**
- `dir /s /b` does NOT work - use PowerShell instead
- File search: `powershell -Command "Get-ChildItem -Path 'X:\path' -Recurse -Filter '*.ext' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName"`
- Basic listing: `ls -la` works

**UE Source Code Location:**
- UE 5.7 source is at: `E:\code\unreal-mcp\ues\UnrealEngine-5.7\UnrealEngine-5.7\Engine\`
- NOT at `E:\code\ues\` - the ues folder is INSIDE this project root

**MCP Connection Errors:**
- `[WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host` - This means Unreal Engine has **crashed**. Check the crash log for the call stack and restart the editor.

**Context7 for UE API Research (CRITICAL):**
- **ALWAYS use Context7 MCP tools before writing or modifying C++ code** that uses Unreal Engine APIs
- Use `resolve-library-id` with `libraryName: "Unreal Engine"` to get the library ID
- Use `query-docs` with the library ID `/websites/dev_epicgames_en-us_unreal-engine` for API lookups
- This ensures you use correct, up-to-date API signatures instead of guessing or using outdated patterns
- Example workflow:
  1. `resolve-library-id` → find UE library
  2. `query-docs` → search for specific class/function (e.g., "UNiagaraNodeFunctionCall SetEnabled")
  3. Implement using the documented API

## Build & Launch Commands

### Building the C++ Plugin
```powershell
# IMPORTANT: Always use this exact command format (not ./RebuildProject.bat or cmd /c)
powershell -Command "& {cd e:\code\unreal-mcp; .\RebuildProject.bat}"

# This script:
# 1. Terminates all UnrealEditor*.exe processes
# 2. Cleans Intermediate and Binaries folders
# 3. Calls UE 5.7's Build.bat for MCPGameProjectEditor Win64 Development
# 4. Targets: MCPGameProject\MCPGameProject.uproject
```

### Launching Unreal Editor
```powershell
# IMPORTANT: Always use this exact command format (not ./LaunchProject.bat or cmd /c)
powershell -Command "& {cd e:\code\unreal-mcp; .\LaunchProject.bat}"

# Uses: C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe
# Opens: E:\code\unreal-mcp\MCPGameProject\MCPGameProject.uproject
```

### Python MCP Server Setup
```bash
cd Python
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
uv pip install -e .

# Servers are being run by user manually via VSCode launch configurations.
```

## Architecture Overview

### Dual-Component System

This project enables **natural language control of Unreal Engine 5.7** through AI assistants via a synchronized dual-component architecture:

```
AI Assistant (Claude/Cursor/Windsurf)
    ↓ [MCP Protocol]
Python MCP Servers (7 FastMCP servers)
    ↓ [TCP/JSON on 127.0.0.1:55557]
C++ Plugin (UnrealMCP EditorSubsystem)
    ↓ [Direct API calls]
Unreal Engine 5.7 Editor
```

### Critical Synchronization Requirement

**Both Python and C++ sides MUST remain synchronized when adding functionality:**
- Function signatures, parameter names, types, and return values must match exactly
- TCP command strings in Python must correspond to registered dispatcher commands in C++
- JSON payloads between Python and C++ must maintain identical schemas

### Component Locations

**Python MCP Servers**: `Python/`
- 7 independent FastMCP servers (blueprint, editor, umg, node, datatable, project, blueprint_action)
- **MCP tools are defined in `*_mcp_server.py` files** (NOT in `*_tools/` folders)
- Shared utilities in `utils/` (blueprints/, nodes/, umg/, datatable/, editor/, project/)
- TCP communication via `utils/unreal_connection_utils.py` (connects to 127.0.0.1:55557)

**C++ Plugin**: `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP/`
- Main dispatcher: `Commands/UnrealMCPMainDispatcher.h/.cpp`
- Command categories in `Commands/*/` (Blueprint, BlueprintAction, BlueprintNode, GraphManipulation, Editor, UMG, DataTable, Project)
- Service layer in `Services/*/` (business logic separated from commands)
- Factories in `Factories/` (ComponentFactory, WidgetFactory for type-safe object creation)

### Module Initialization Flow

**C++ Plugin Startup** (`UnrealMCPModule::StartupModule`):
1. Initialize `FMCPLogger` (file logging enabled)
2. Initialize `FObjectPoolManager` (performance optimization)
3. Initialize `FComponentFactory::InitializeDefaultTypes()` (register component types)
4. Initialize `FWidgetFactory::InitializeDefaultWidgetTypes()` (register widget types)
5. Initialize `FUnrealMCPMainDispatcher::Initialize()` (register all commands)

**EditorSubsystem Startup** (`UUnrealMCPBridge::Initialize`):
1. Create TCP listener socket on 127.0.0.1:55557
2. Start `MCPServerRunnable` thread (async command loop)
3. Accept connections, read JSON commands (48KB buffer), execute via dispatcher, send responses

### Command Execution Pattern

**Adding a new tool requires changes in both components:**

**Python Side** (example: `Python/blueprint_mcp_server.py`):
```python
@app.tool()
async def create_blueprint(name: str, parent_class: str, folder_path: str = "") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create a new Blueprint class."""
    params = {"name": name, "parent_class": parent_class}
    if folder_path:
        params["folder_path"] = folder_path
    return await send_tcp_command("create_blueprint", params)
```

**C++ Side** (example: `Commands/Blueprint/CreateBlueprintCommand.cpp`):
```cpp
class FCreateBlueprintCommand : public IUnrealMCPCommand
{
    FString CommandName() const override { return TEXT("create_blueprint"); }
    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> Execute(const TSharedPtr<FJsonObject>& Params) override;
};
// Register in FBlueprintCommandRegistration::RegisterAllBlueprintCommands()
```

**Command Registry System**:
- Commands implement `IUnrealMCPCommand` interface
- Registered via category-specific registration functions (e.g., `FBlueprintCommandRegistration::RegisterAllBlueprintCommands`)
- Dispatcher routes commands via `FUnrealMCPMainDispatcher::HandleCommand(CommandType, Params)`
- Returns JSON responses (48KB buffer for detailed errors/large payloads)

## Development Workflow

### MCP Implementation Plans: Mandatory Debugging Checkpoints (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ BEFORE creating ANY plan for UE functionality via MCP tools, this section MUST be followed.**

When implementing complex functionality (inventory systems, dialogue systems, game mechanics, etc.) through MCP tools:

1. **Every step in every phase MUST have a verification checkpoint**
   - Even "simple" data creation (structs, enums, DataTables) must be verified
   - Do NOT batch multiple steps without intermediate verification
   - Do NOT proceed to next step until current step is verified working

2. **Verification checkpoint requirements:**
   - After creating any asset (struct, enum, DataTable): Confirm it exists with correct properties via `get_*_metadata` tools
   - After completing a function's node logic: Compile Blueprint and check for errors
   - After completing a phase: User verification checkpoint before proceeding
   - Note: Do NOT compile after every single node - compile once when full function is complete

3. **Debug-first plan structure:**
   ```
   Step X.Y: [Action]
   - MCP Tool Call: [specific tool and params]
   - Verification: [how to confirm it worked]
   - Expected Result: [what success looks like]
   - Debug Point: [what to check if it fails]
   ```

4. **When errors occur:**
   - STOP immediately - do not continue building on broken foundation
   - Identify the exact step that failed
   - Fix that step and re-verify before continuing
   - Document any MCP tool limitations in `Docs/known-issues.md`

5. **Phase completion gates:**
   - ALL steps in current phase must be verified before starting next phase
   - No "we'll fix it later" - fix it now or document as blocked

**Rationale:** MCP-created Blueprint logic is difficult to debug after the fact. Each step builds on previous steps. One incorrect node connection early on cascades into complex debugging later. Verify early, verify often.

### Test-First Phase Planning (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ Phases MUST be structured for earliest possible testing, NOT by architectural layer.**

**The Problem:**
Traditional layered approach (Data → Blueprint Logic → Widgets) delays testing until ALL layers are complete. When bugs appear, you have a massive interconnected system to debug with no working baseline.

**The Solution: UI-First, Data-Second, Logic-Last**

```
WRONG ORDER (delays testing):          RIGHT ORDER (early testing):
1. Create data structures               1. Create widget visuals (hardcoded data)
2. Create Blueprint logic               2. Test widget layout/interactions manually
3. Create widgets                       3. Create data structures
4. NOW you can finally test             4. Connect data to widgets, test with real data
   → Debugging nightmare                5. Create Blueprint logic incrementally
                                        6. Test each function as it's added
                                           → Bugs caught immediately
```

**Phase Planning Rules:**

1. **Widgets First**: Create UI widgets with hardcoded/mock data
   - User can visually verify layout, colors, sizing
   - Test click handlers, hover states, animations
   - No dependencies on data layer yet

2. **Data Layer Second**: Create structs, DataTables, managers
   - Connect to existing widgets
   - Test that real data displays correctly
   - Widget bugs are already fixed at this point

3. **Blueprint Logic Last (or in parallel)**: Complex game logic
   - Each function tested immediately after creation
   - Widget + data layer already verified working
   - Logic bugs are isolated, not cascading

4. **Parallel Work When Possible**:
   - Widget visual work can happen alongside data structure creation
   - Simple BP functions (getters, setters) can be added early
   - Complex logic waits until UI is verified

**Example - Inventory System (Correct Order):**
```
Phase 1: Widget Skeleton
- Create WBP_InventorySlot with hardcoded icon
- Create WBP_InventoryGrid with hardcoded slots
- USER TEST: "Does the grid look right? Can I click slots?"

Phase 2: Data + Widget Connection
- Create S_InventorySlot struct
- Create DT_Items DataTable
- Connect DataTable to widgets
- USER TEST: "Do real items show with correct icons?"

Phase 3: Manager Logic
- Create BP_InventoryManager
- Implement AddItem function → TEST
- Implement RemoveItem function → TEST
- Each function tested in isolation
```

**Key Principle:** After each phase, the user should be able to launch Unreal, interact with something, and verify it works. If a phase doesn't end with a testable deliverable, the phase is too large - split it.

### Adding New Functionality

1. **Plan cross-component**: Design Python API signature and C++ implementation together
2. **Implement C++ command handler**:
   - Create command class in appropriate `Commands/*/` folder
   - Implement `IUnrealMCPCommand` interface (`CommandName()` and `Execute()`)
   - Register in category's registration function
   - Use service layer for business logic
3. **Create Python MCP tool**:
   - Add `@app.tool()` decorated function in the correct `*_mcp_server.py` file (see table below)
   - Use `await send_tcp_command(command_type, params)` to call C++ side
4. **Compile and test**:
   - Run `RebuildProject.bat` to compile C++ changes
   - Run `LaunchProject.bat` to start Unreal Editor
   - **Restart Python MCP servers** for Python changes to take effect
   - Test via AI assistant natural language or Python test scripts

### Service Layer Architecture

The C++ plugin uses a **modular service layer pattern** for clean separation of concerns:

**Service Organization**:
- **Services/Blueprint/** - Blueprint creation, properties, functions, caching
  - `BlueprintCreationService` - Blueprint class creation
  - `BlueprintPropertyService` - Property management
  - `BlueprintFunctionService` - Function operations
  - `BlueprintCacheService` - Asset caching

- **Services/BlueprintAction/** - Action database querying and discovery
  - `BlueprintActionDiscoveryService` - Action database searches
  - `BlueprintActionSearchService` - Action filtering
  - `BlueprintClassSearchService` - Class hierarchy exploration
  - `BlueprintPinSearchService` - Pin type searches
  - `BlueprintNodePinInfoService` - Pin metadata

- **Services/NodeCreation/** - Node creation strategies
  - `BlueprintActionDatabaseNodeCreator` - Database-driven creation
  - `ArithmeticNodeCreator` - Math operation nodes
  - `NativePropertyNodeCreator` - Property getter/setter nodes
  - `NodeCreationHelpers` - Shared utilities
  - `NodeResultBuilder` - Response formatting

- **Services/UMG/** - Widget operations (split into specialized files)

- **Commands/** - Thin handlers that validate params and call services

- **Factories/** - Type-safe object creation (ComponentFactory, WidgetFactory)

### File Size Guidelines (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ NEVER CREATE FILES LARGER THAN 1000 LINES**
- Target: 800 lines per file
- Absolute limit: 1000 lines
- See `.github/large-cpp-files.md` for existing problematic files
- When refactoring: Split into multiple smaller, focused files
- Recent refactoring examples:
  - `BlueprintService` → `BlueprintCreationService`, `BlueprintPropertyService`, `BlueprintFunctionService`, `BlueprintCacheService`
  - `BlueprintNodeCreationService` → `ControlFlowNodeCreator`, `EventAndVariableNodeCreator`
  - `UnrealMCPCommonUtils` → 6 specialized utility classes

**⚠️ ALWAYS CHECK FILE SIZE AFTER ADDING CODE**
- After adding new functions, check the file's line count
- If file exceeds 800 lines, proactively suggest splitting to user
- If file exceeds 1000 lines, MUST split before committing
- Split methodology: Extract functions as-is into new focused files (no refactoring during split)

## Unreal Engine Specifics

### Version & APIs
- **Using Unreal Engine 5.7** - Be cautious of deprecated/outdated APIs
- Reference full UE 5.7 source in `ues/UnrealEngine-5.7/` for API documentation
- Due to large folder size - use OS file search tools to locate specific classes/functions when needed

### Coordinate System
- **Z-up, left-handed coordinate system**
- X-axis (Red): Forward/backward (positive = forward)
- Y-axis (Green): Left/right (positive = right)
- Z-axis (Blue): Up/down (positive = up)

### Units
- Distance: Centimeters (cm)
- Mass: Kilograms (kg)
- Time: Seconds (s)
- Angles: Degrees (deg)
- Speed: Meters per second (m/s)
- Force: Newtons (N)

### TCP Configuration
```cpp
// C++: UnrealMCPBridge.cpp
#define MCP_SERVER_HOST "127.0.0.1"
#define MCP_SERVER_PORT 55557
```

```python
# Python: utils/unreal_connection_utils.py
UNREAL_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
UNREAL_PORT = 55557
```

## Python MCP Tool Guidelines

### Where to Modify MCP Tools (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ MCP tools are defined ONLY in `Python/*_mcp_server.py` files:**

| MCP Server File | Purpose | C++ Command Category |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|
| `blueprint_mcp_server.py` | Blueprint creation, compilation, variables, components, interfaces, metadata | `Commands/Blueprint/` |
| `editor_mcp_server.py` | Actor spawning, transforms, viewport, light properties | `Commands/Editor/` |
| `umg_mcp_server.py` | Widget Blueprints, UI components, layouts, bindings | `Commands/UMG/` |
| `node_mcp_server.py` | Node connections, pin values, graph manipulation | `Commands/BlueprintNode/`, `Commands/GraphManipulation/` |
| `datatable_mcp_server.py` | DataTable creation, CRUD operations | `Commands/DataTable/` |
| `project_mcp_server.py` | Folders, input mappings, structs, enums | `Commands/Project/` |
| `blueprint_action_mcp_server.py` | Action discovery, node creation, pin inspection | `Commands/BlueprintAction/` |
| `statetree_mcp_server.py` | StateTree creation, states, transitions, tasks, conditions, evaluators, bindings | `Commands/StateTree/` |
| `mesh_mcp_server.py` | Static Mesh LOD management, metadata, auto-generation, screen sizes | `Commands/Mesh/` |
| `animation_mcp_server.py` | Animation Blueprint creation; **AnimMontage / AnimSequence read-only inspection** (sections, slots, notifies, sync markers) | `Commands/Animation/` |
| `behaviortree_mcp_server.py` | **Read-only inspection** of BehaviorTree node trees and Blackboard keys (neither asset class is a UBlueprint, so `find_in_blueprints` cannot reach them) | `Commands/BehaviorTree/` |

**These `*_mcp_server.py` files contain the `@app.tool()` decorated functions that Claude/AI assistants actually call.**

**⚠️ DO NOT modify these folders for MCP tool changes:**
- `Python/blueprint_tools/` - Legacy/unused implementations
- `Python/utils/` - Shared utility functions (called BY MCP servers, not MCP tools themselves)
- `Python/*_tools/` - Helper modules (may be imported by MCP servers but are NOT the tool entry points)

**When adding/modifying MCP tool parameters:**
1. Identify the correct `*_mcp_server.py` file from the table above
2. Add/modify the `@app.tool()` decorated async function
3. Add parameter to the `params` dict passed to `send_tcp_command()`
4. Update the docstring with new parameter documentation
5. **Restart the Python MCP server** for changes to take effect (user runs via VSCode)

### Parameter Type Guidelines

**For functions decorated with `@app.tool()`:**
- Parameters should NOT use types: `Any`, `object`, `Optional[T]`, `Union[T]`
- For parameters with default values, use `x: T = None` NOT `x: T | None = None`
- Handle defaults within method body
- Always include comprehensive docstrings with valid input examples

## Key Extension Categories

- **Blueprint**: Class creation, compilation, components, variables, interfaces
- **BlueprintAction**: Dynamic node discovery, pin analysis, class hierarchy exploration
- **BlueprintNode**: Event nodes, function calls, pin connections, graph manipulation
- **GraphManipulation**: Replace nodes, disconnect pins, delete nodes (preserves connections)
- **Editor**: Actor spawning/management, transforms, viewport control, light properties
- **UMG**: Widget Blueprint creation, UI components, layouts, event/property bindings
- **DataTable**: Create tables, CRUD operations, struct-based data management
- **Project**: Folders, input mappings, Enhanced Input System (UE 5.5+), structs

## Blueprint Architecture Best Practices

**⚠️ All game logic should be implemented in custom functions, NOT in EventGraph:**
- EventGraph should only contain event bindings (BeginPlay, Tick, Input Actions) that call custom functions
- Complex logic belongs in dedicated custom functions for better organization and debugging
- This makes orphan detection more reliable (EventGraph has special entry points like Enhanced Input Actions)
- Easier to test, refactor, and maintain individual functions

**When working with orphan detection/cleanup:**
- Always scope operations to specific graphs (e.g., `target_graph="MyFunction"`)
- EventGraph should generally be excluded from automatic orphan deletion due to its special nature
- Development workflow typically focuses on one function at a time - tools should support this

**Return Node handling:**
- Every function has an auto-generated Return Node at (0,0) - this may appear orphaned if unused
- For non-void functions, always connect the final exec flow to the Return Node
- Pure functions don't have exec pins - they use data flow only

## Important Implementation Files

**C++ Entry Points:**
- `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP/Source/UnrealMCP/Private/UnrealMCPModule.cpp` - Module startup/shutdown
- `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP/Source/UnrealMCP/Private/UnrealMCPBridge.cpp` - TCP server subsystem
- `Commands/UnrealMCPMainDispatcher.h/.cpp` - Central command router
- `Commands/UnrealMCPCommandRegistry.cpp` - Command registration system

**Python Entry Points:**
- `Python/*_mcp_server.py` - 7 independent MCP servers
- `Python/utils/unreal_connection_utils.py` - TCP connection management

**Configuration:**
- MCP client configs (Claude Desktop: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json`)
- Python dependencies: `Python/pyproject.toml`
- Plugin manifest: `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP/UnrealMCP.uplugin`

## Recent Architecture Improvements

The codebase has undergone significant refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability:

1. **Service Layer Modularization**: Large service files split into focused, specialized classes
2. **Node Creation Strategy Pattern**: Separate creator classes for different node types
3. **Blueprint Action Services**: Dedicated services for action discovery, searching, and pin analysis
4. **Utility Class Decomposition**: Common utilities split into domain-specific modules
5. **Command Registration Pattern**: Centralized registry with category-specific registration functions

When adding new features, follow these established patterns for consistency and maintainability.

## MCP Tool Development: Trace Before Change (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ ALWAYS trace the COMPLETE code flow before modifying MCP tools.**

MCP node creation has a complex multi-stage dispatch flow. DO NOT make changes based on assumptions about a single file. The flow involves multiple files with fallback logic.

**How it works (JUST AN EXAMPLE):**
1. If `class_name` matches a parent Blueprint class, checks `GeneratedClass` properties
2. If variable not found locally and no `class_name` specified, automatically checks parent hierarchy
3. Inherited variables use `SetSelfMember` since they're accessible via self reference

### Before Modifying MCP Tools:

1. **Read ALL files in the dispatch chain** - not just the file where you think the fix goes
2. **Understand which stage handles what** - see flow diagram above
3. **Check fallback logic** - many stages have "if not found, try next" patterns
4. **Test with logging** - each stage logs to `LogTemp` with function name prefix
5. **Verify the issue isn't handled elsewhere** - the fix might belong in a different stage

## Runtime Debugging via Print String

**Print String nodes created via MCP automatically have `bPrintToLog=true`.**

This means all Print String output is written to the UE log file, enabling post-mortem analysis by AI after PIE sessions.

### Log File Location
```
MCPGameProject/Saved/Logs/MCPGameProject.log
```

### Log Category
Print String output uses the `LogBlueprintUserMessages` category. To filter:
```python
Grep(pattern="LogBlueprintUserMessages", path="MCPGameProject/Saved/Logs/MCPGameProject.log")
```

### Workflow for AI-Assisted Debugging
1. AI adds Print String nodes to Blueprint functions for tracing
2. User runs PIE and reproduces the issue
3. User stops PIE
4. AI reads log file via `Read` tool to analyze runtime behavior
5. AI identifies the issue based on logged values

### Reading the Log
```python
# AI can read the log after PIE session ends
Read(file_path="unreal-mcp/MCPGameProject/Saved/Logs/MCPGameProject.log")
```

### Log Accumulation Note
The log file persists across multiple PIE sessions within the same Editor session. When debugging iteratively:
- Use distinctive prefixes in Print String messages (e.g., `[DEBUG:FunctionName]`)
- Look for the MOST RECENT occurrences of your trace messages
- A new Editor launch creates a new log file

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

**Check `Docs/known-issues.md` for:**
- MCP tool limitations discovered during development
- Feature requests for future implementation
- Workarounds for known problems

**When encountering MCP limitations:**
1. Document the issue in `Docs/known-issues.md`
2. Include: what failed, expected behavior, any workarounds
3. Tag with affected tool names for searchability
